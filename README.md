A Mindustry mod written in Java.

My first ever Java mod for Mindustry.

To be used as an example and a template for Java mods, going forward.

<br>

**This mod just adds some new instances of the following things to the game:**

* Serpulo Turrets

* Erekir Turrets

* Experimental Turrets

* Serpulo Units

* Erekir Units

<br>

**Building for Desktop (PC):**

1. Install JDK 17 (or 18).
2. On Linux, run: `./gradlew build`
3. Your mod jar will be in the `build/libs` directory. 

**Note:** Only use this version for testing on desktop. It will not work with Android.

To build an Android-compatible version, you need the Android SDK. You can either let Github Actions handle this, or set it up yourself.
